# Sorting COVID-19 Data from Twitter

This program takes COVID-19 related keywords and displays Twitter search results based on the amount of tweets the user wants displayed, as well as a date limit (how far back the tweets go). In addition, the user can filter this data based on the contents of the tweet using a subjectivity rating (i.e., whether or not the tweet is based on factual evidence) and a polarity rating (i.e., how positive the tweets tend to be based on key words). All this data is displayed back to the user in a table, using the parameters set by them at the beginning. It creates an interactive COVID-19 news feed that can be further utilized for analysis purposes.

# What's Next?

Next steps for this project could include: analyzing tweets for repeated phrases and creating search terms based on those phrases, generating a news feed for objectively-ranked posts, and more.
